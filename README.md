Project: **Phone Number & Email Scraper** (phone_number_scrap.py)

The Phone Number & Email Scraper is a simple Python script that extracts contact details directly from your clipboard. Just copy any document or text containing emails and phone numbers, then run the script — it will scan the clipboard content, extract valid phone numbers and email addresses, and copy them back to your clipboard for easy reuse. This makes it a quick utility for cleaning and retrieving contact information without manual effort.

Project: **File Organizer** (file_organizer.py)

The File Organizer is a Python desktop application built with Tkinter that helps automate folder organization. Users can select a folder, choose whether to organize files by type, date created, or file size, and then run the organizer to neatly arrange everything into subfolders. An undo feature allows reverting the last changes, while a built-in log panel displays real-time actions. Logs can be reset from the interface and are also saved as a log file in the same directory for future reference.

Project: **Automated Web Scraper & Report Generator** (scrap_data_generate_report.py)

Developed a Python automation pipeline that scrapes multi-page book catalog data (title, price, rating, stock) from Books to Scrape. The data is cleaned and exported into Excel, then automatically emailed as a daily report to stakeholders. The project demonstrates practical skills in web scraping, data transformation, Excel automation, and email integration — applicable to e-commerce, product monitoring, and job listing platforms.

Project: **Git Automation with PyAutoGUI & OCR**

This project automates Git operations using PyAutoGUI for keyboard/mouse control and Pytesseract for OCR-based screen reading.
It opens a terminal, checks repository status, and automatically runs git add, git commit, and git push when changes are detected.
The script smartly waits until push completion by reading terminal output with OCR before showing success messages.
